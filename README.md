# Horiseon-Website-Refactor

## Description
This is a Code Refactor of a Online Web Services company website named "Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc.

I built this project to get experience refactoring old HTML and CSS code, and increase its accessibility for search engine optimization. 

Much of the initial HTML code did not employ semantic tags or alt attributes for images. These semantic tags and attributes have been added to icrease accessibility. 

Much of the CSS classes have been consolidated and unecessary duplicate declarations were removed.
