# Homework Guide

Each week, your instructor will add instructions for that week’s homework assignment to the class repo and announce that it’s ready. Your instructors and TAs will also provide a demonstration of the homework in the classroom.

## How to Work on Homework

Homework is designed to prepare you for two scenarios that you will encounter as a developer:

- On-the-job tickets or feature requests

- Job-seeking coding assessments or take-home assignments

On-the-job ticket homework will provide you with starter code in a folder called `Develop`. You’ll modify or add to this code to complete the homework. Odd-numbered units follow this format.

Job-seeking coding assessments do not provide starter code. You’ll build these from scratch. Even-numbered units follow this format.

All of the homework assignments follow agile project management conventions, providing a user story, acceptance criteria, a mock-up demonstrating the application functionality, and review guidelines.

### User Story

Part of being a developer is putting yourself in the shoes of your audience and imagining their experience with the application you’re creating.

A user story, or persona, is a description of an application using natural, non-technical language. Written from the perspective of the application’s end user, they help developers organize their work by allowing them to understand an application’s context and who will be using it.

### Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance criteria are the requirements that must be met to complete a user story. They define the boundaries of the user story and are used to confirm when a story is completed.

These criteria can be thought of as instructions for how you should complete a homework assignment. As you plan how to build the application, use them to structure your pages and pseudocode your logic. As you’re working, look back at the list of acceptance criteria to make sure you’ve met all of them. An application is complete only when it meets all of these criteria.

### Review

In the real world, when a developer finishes working on an issue, another developer reviews the code, providing feedback on errors and making sure that all of the acceptance criteria have been met. For the homework assignments, your TAs will serve as your reviewers.

To submit your application for review, you are required to provide the following:

- The URL of the deployed application.

- The URL of the GitHub repository. Give the repository a unique name and include a README describing the project.

### Repo Quality

Treat every homework assignment as a professional production. You will end up using many of these assignments as works in your portfolio. As such, the quality of the app AND THE REPO may be evaluated by potential employers. Plus, its good practice for your next job.

#### Always Include a README

A README file acts like a virtual storefront to a repository—it's the first thing that a person sees when they visit a repo on GitHub. But it's also much more than that: README files contain essential information about the repo's project. Thus, the quality of a README file can differentiate a high-quality repo from a low-quality one.

#### Commits

- **Make commits frequently.** Each time you check off an acceptence criteria, solve a difficult step in your app, or want to create a save your code, create a commit.

- **Make commit messages descriptive.** Make concise, yet specific commit messages. Good example: "Add navbar to home page". Bad examples: "Add stuff", "Changes", "Working", "Deploying", "Deploying again", etc. Don't be vague! Stop for a minute and think about what you've done since the last commit you made.

#### Use Folders to Organize

Follow a consist naming scheme for organizing your files. Use the solutions to the in-class mini-projects as a guide.
